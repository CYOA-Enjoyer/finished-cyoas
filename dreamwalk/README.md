## Sleep Powers

### Asleep At Will
**You fall asleep and wake up at will.** Any emergencies or alarms you set up will still wake you up.

It is possible to sleep for any arbitrary amount of time using this power as long as your body is not in danger. This also allows you to freely switch between dreams.

### Increased Willpower
**You do not get distracted easily** in your dreams and pursue your goals with full power. You automatically get into a flow state the moment you start doing anything you find interesting.

### Time Reballance x1
**Time spent inside a dream flows twice as fast** giving you twice as much time relative to Earth. Can be bought up to three times, effects are multiplicative. You can have dreams inside other dreams, but the Time Rebalance is not cumulative.

## Dream Control

### World Control
**You can control the world in your dreams.** This includes geography, climate, buildings and vehicles. They have to be within the limits of physics unless you can control the laws of nature too.

### Nature Control
**You can control the laws of nature inside your dreams.** This allows for things like porn logic, floating islands or flying, fire breathing dragons. This allows for casting low power magic spells.

### Body Control
**You can control your body in your dreams.** This includes your species, race, gender, attractiveness, strength and fitness. Your body has to be biologically possible unless you can control the laws of nature. Without this option you can choose to use your body from Earth or become similar to an average citizen from the dream or a random human if there are none.

## Dream Powers

### Dream Garden
When dreaming **you can choose to appear in your Dream Garden. You can enter this place as many times as you want.** Initially your garden is just a pocket plane with diameter of 1km filled with trees and wildlife. You can bring anything you can carry in a human form from any of your dreams except anything sapient. You can do the same by copying things from real life. Dream Control powers do not work inside the Dream Garden.

### Companions
**You get five companion slots.** You can assign any person met in a dream as your companion and undo assignments at will. In every dream you can choose to have any number of them to accompany you. Your companions can enter your Dream Garden. They can still travel back to visit their original lives.

### Entertaining
**Everything will be more entertaining**, emotional, dramatic, cool or simply pleasant. Both to you and if you decide to share your stories with someone. You can control the strength of these aspects.

## Minor powers

### Flying
**You can fly** at around half the speed of sound without using wings of any kind. You can carry an average human with you.

### Battle Skills
**From fistfights to sword duels to battle tactics, you excel at them all.** If the dream has magic this option includes fireballs, barriers, cloaking, summoned weapons and similar. Your skills allow you to fight with most of beings you can encounter in dreams on equal footing.

### Teleportation
**You can teleport anywhere you have been before** within the same dream. You can also make up to three sets of portals with the same restriction.

### Camera
When inside a dream **you get a professional camera** of your choice (you can change your choice later) and **anything you record will appear on your PC when you wake up** . Everyone will believe you've recorded / made the footage yourself without asking any questions.

### Stylized Footage
**Requires [Camera](#camera).**

You can choose to get the **footage transformed into any visual style** you want. Realistic 3D, stylized 3D, anime, wester animation, simplified linear or anything else that would be possible to achieve by a professional studio. You get a live preview of the styles on the camera screen.

### Additional Footage
**Requires [Camera](#camera).**

You get **additional footage from your perspective and two more from a third person perspective** situated in a way to show as much of the action as possible in a compelling way — it might even show events you didn't see yourself as long as they are relevant to what happened to you.

## Tasks

### Young Succubi Teacher
`2000 hours` `chastity` `befriendable`

“I know a principal of the Succubi and Incubi School of Cumpton and they will gladly hire you. In my time there, we only had one human teacher and honestly, everyone was scared of her.”

Human education is highly valued by fantastical beings. You will teach your pupils on the level between your middle and high school. All of them are incredibly sexy, some of them are also very open about their desires and the fullfillment of those, even during lessons. Despite that, you will find them honest and hardworking. You can choose the genders of your students.

### Pleasuring Distrubing Monsters
`200 hours`

There are some creatures that consider humans to be very cute and very sexy. Some of them are completely alien while others disturbingly close to humans, but none can communicate with you. They will never intentionally harm you but also will not let you go until they are sure you had a good time, or until you give up. You can choose their genders if it helps in any way.

### Milking
`700 hours`

You get milked for milk and/or cum. Your nipples and genitals get stimulated non-stop, regardless of your gender.

### Stallion/Mother-queen Aid
`700 hours` `chastity` `befriendable`

Some species have a very strong disparity between genders. Individuals that have sex with thousands or more insignificant partners eventually get bored of it. Your task will be to aid these stallions or mother-queens in finding new and exciting ways of procreating. Either by teaching them new sex ideas, because they are completely vanilla right now or by pleasuring them yourself. Your partners will treat you as a mentor and be grateful to you. All of their mates will be submissive to both you and them. You can choose the gender of your partner and when to switch to a new one. All of your partners and their mates will be attractive to you.

### Dreamweaver
`9000 hours` `befriendable`

You are tasked with designing dreams for others that evoke specified emotions. You can enter their dreams and use all of your powers there. If you have practice creating experiences for others, for example you were acting as a game master or you published at least one CYOA you get two points worth of power for this task.

### Intercourse Instructor
`2000 hours` `chastity` `befriendable`

There are many tribes of wild elves who have forgotten how to make babies. You will get a strap-on dildo and a task of teaching them about the pleasures and mechanics of sex. They are eager to learn and will listen to you dutifully. Your own genitalia will be locked in chastity in addition to the spell.

### Living Sex Toy
`2000 hours`

A portal will be attached to your genitalia. This job is active in your normal dreams but not when doing other tasks. The other end of the portal will be given as a sex toy to a group of people of your specified genders. They will not try to harm you on purpose though some of them might handle you a little roughly. There will be enough of them and they will be horny enough to use you almost constantly. A spell will be put on you preventing you from getting limp, dry or injured.
