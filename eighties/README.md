## Goals
- Small Inheritance
  - Once you've graduated from high school, you will get a small inheritance from a distance relative. You get a very small house or a small apartment anywhere you want. The area, however, should typically be middle-class or less. For example, a house at Malibu Beach won't be possible. You also get $8k (roughly $20k in today's money) to start your new life in the 80s in whichever way you want.

## Basic Skills
- Geek
  - If you wish to go the academic route but currently lack the skills, this might be for you. Pick any major field and you'll know all the basics and even a little more. You also get a talent for studying new things in general. University will be no issue for you if you put in just a little bit of effort. If you want this can also turn all the other geeky girls and/or boys at your school into much hotter versions of themselves.

## Perks
- Detention
  - Rules can be very strict. Especially if you're distracted! With this option you will never get kicked out of school or face any serious consequences for your behaviour. The worst that could happen is that you get detention and have to spend some of your free time in the school library.
- Stranger Danger
  - A rather attractive elderly lady or gentleman has an eye on you and your sexy young body. He or she is very experienced in the art of lovemaking and can be either dominant or submissive (the choice is yours). Should you give in, I'm sure there's quite a lot of extra pocket money in it for you.
- Car
  - You get a car. A pretty decent car even. It'll make it much easier for you to get from A to be and can also add some coolness factor. Nearby you will find a pretty well-known spot for new couples to make out (and have sex) in their car! There are never any cops to stop you but maybe some rogue cop likes to watch and jerk off every once in a while.
- Home Alone
  - Somehow your parents are never at home and you'll always have the house for yourself. A cleaning lady comes on Wednesdays but that doesn't mean you can just dirty up the place as much as you want. She'll definitely rat on you if it gets out of hand! You'll find money for take-out food on the kitchen table every morning. Did someone say house party?
- Dungeons & Dragons
  - You get invited to the sexiest Dungeons & Dragons group in town. It's a pretty large group and you all have access to costume that would make a Hollywood film studio jealous. Everyone loves to roleplay and the group acts out even the naughtiest parts of the adventure.
- First Base
  - You want to increase your odds? With this option every date will end at least in some groping and have petting if you want to. You will still have to manage to get a date in the first place and not every partner will allow the heavy petting because they are super into you but it will definitely happen if that's what you want.
- Second Base
  - Just because you're back in high school doesn't mean you have to just do high school stuff and only do heavy petting. This is the same as "First Base" but now your dates will have guaranteed oral sex. It's up to you if you're on the giving or receiving end ;)
- Home Run
  - I think you know where this is going. Just manage to get a date and the rest will work out. Of course you don't need these options to get sex but it makes it a WHOLE lot easier.

## Events
- Prom
  - It's just 1 night but it's a night some will never forget. You and your prom date will enjoy a magical night of song and dance. Limousine service and a stay in one of the finest hotel suits in the world are obviously included. The punch comes pre-spiked as well.
- Summer Camp
  - The outdoors, games and a huge surplus of hormones. This two week trip to a Summer Camp might not be as excessive as some of the other choices but it might get a lot more romantic and meaningful.

## Special Events
- NeverEnding Story
  - An old library book sucks you in and you have to save a magical kingdom filled with dragons, stone monsters and a beautiful prince or princess.
  - Permanent Bonus: You will never get sucked into a story as much as with this book but from this day on, every time you read a book you can vividly see what is going on in your mind. It's not like you're there but it turns every book into the best produced movie you've ever seen.
- Weird Science
  - 80s science was a lot easier than modern science! Some colourful chemicals and a bit of electricity and you made yourself the perfect sexual companion. This will lead to a week or so of wacky adventures throughout town and an almost unhealthy amount of sex.
  - Permanent Bonus: Your sexual companion will teach you everything there is to know about sex. Every partner you will have in the future will swear that your lovemaking skills are beyond what is humanly possible.
