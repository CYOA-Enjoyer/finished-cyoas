### Starting Pool - Builder Mode

## System Creation
- **Heads Up Display (HUD)**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    - Another free option, albeit one that is most in theme for The Gamer: It wouldn't be much of a Gamer ability if you didn't have a way of seeing the world like a game, now wouldn't it?
    <br>
    - You gain a heads-up-display, as well as the ability for your System to project squares that act like pop up menus in a video game in your perspective. No one else can see these squares, or their contents of text. Whatever stats or settings your System has that can be displayed, you can navigate & view them easily, as well as interact with them through either your voice aloud or through physically touching them.
    <br>
    - If you want, you can modify these squares, making them bigger or smaller like a window on a computer, or even move them to specific positions. This HUD also comes with a **[Help]** command, which can allow you to easily learn how the System you're using works, as well as what **[Menus]** you have access to.
  </details>
- **HUD+: Hands-Free Interface**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Perhaps it annoys you that you need to say aloud that you're about to punch someone in order to activate a punching-related ability? If so, for 5 SP you can upgrade your HUD so that it works via your mind instead.
  <br>
  - Hands-free interaction with your HUD! Perfect if you want to look at your Status Sheet without weirding people out with your poking and mumbling at stuff no one else can see!
  </details>
- **[Settings]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Something that surprisingly many Systems come without, despite being a Staple of the original Gamer System, [Settings] allows you the ability to toggle on and off whatever upgrades you have added to your System, as well as miscellaneous options you can choose. Want background music, or subtitles? Maybe want to change your System Boxes from the usual blue to a green or amber color depending on your preference for Fallout? Give them textures or make them themed after a specific video game's?
  <br>
  - If you want to change something about the Gamer System in a way that doesn't affect game balance, or could conceivably be found in a game's settings menu? This is the Menu for you, and it's available for free if you want it.
  </details>
- **[Tips/Tutorial]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Your System now gains the ability to tutorialize itself, as well as offer tips for you to take heed of now and then. As well, instead of having to just puzzle things out with only the commands being told to you, you also gain a manual on how your specific system works. Said manual can be summoned as either a Window or as a book in your hand.
  </details>
- **[Normality Filter]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You gain a passive invisible aura that makes it so that anyone in your vicinity, at least within 10 feet, treats anything that occurs as a result of your Gamer System to be completely normal. Afterwards they might start thinking about how weird it is, but at least while they're talking to you in person, they won't find it unusual. Can be toggled on and off for everyone or changed for specific people.
  </details>
- **[Macros]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - By purchasing [Macros], you gain the ability to automate actions. Starts out only allowing small/quick actions to be automated, but eventually through use it gains the ability to do both long and predictive automation. No need to place everything precisely before you do an action!
  <br>
  - Also allows you to give yourself rules that your body will automatically reinforce and abide by once leveled high enough. Never want to kill someone directly? Set it and you'll always only hit hard enough to injure, and find yourself automatically avoid vitals no matter how hard you try.
  </details>
- **[Gamer's Body]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the staples found in the Gamer System, Gamer's Body makes it so that you have the body of a video game character. No matter how badly you are injured, you'll find that your body always works as if it was at 100%. You're able to keep going at peak ability on only a minimum of six hours' sleep, and when you do fall asleep for at least six hours, your body is completely healed.
  <br>
  - Negative conditions like loss of limbs, illnesses or paralysis are also healed when you sleep for six hours, and are treated as status effects.
  </details>
- **[Gamer's Body]+: Super Sleeper**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For only 5 additional SP, you'll now find that the amount of time you require to sleep is much, much less, whether for restorative reasons or for getting the sleep you need. You only need to sleep for an hour in order to see your body healed and negative conditions fixed
  </details>
- **[Super Sleeper]+: Sleep Is For The Weak**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - This costs 10 SP: While you still need to sleep at least an hour in order to heal and cure conditions instantly, you no longer require sleep in order to continue functioning at your fullest, like a Noctis Cape from Worm without the eidetic memory. Think about all the extra time you now have!
  </details>
- **[Gamer's Mind]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Another staple of the Gamer System, if Gamer's Body makes it so that your body acts like a video game character's, then Gamer's Mind grants you the mentality of someone playing a video game. Whether it be drugs, mind control, mental illnesses or anything that could effect you mentally, you will find yourself totally immune to it. Nothing can break through this immunity, and because of it you are also immune to boredom & mental exhaustion.
  - This doesn't just effect your mind state however, for Gamer's Mind also reinforces you emotionally: No matter what, you'll always be able to keep your cool and keep yourself from being overwhelmed emotionally. This doesn't mean that you'll find your emotions muted nor does it mean that you'll become a sociopath, it simply means that you're granted the self-control needed to always overcome it affecting your decisions, no matter how mad or saddened you might be.
  </details>
- **[Gamer's Mind]+ Mind Like A Steel Trap**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You'll now find that while before it would be possible for things to slip your mind, albeit never in a way that diminished your abilities, you now have an eidetic memory. You'll never forget something unless you want to specifically, and will always remember it with perfect clarity without the possibility of time fading said memory. And all for the low price of 10 SP.
  </details>
- **MP System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Magic/Mana/etc. Points as it's known, by purchasing this staple of the original Gamer System, you gain access to mana (or whatever you call it), as well as the ability to cast magic using it. If you enter a setting or world where magic is already a thing, then it can also be used to learn spells from that system of magic, as well as cast them. Some skills & abilities you can learn might require it, although anything involving magic always will. Used up MP will always recover when given enough time.
  <br>
  - If you purchase Gamer's Body, then used MP will refill completely after six hours of sleep.
  <br>
  - If you purchase Levels, then when you level up, MP is both restored and it's maximum amount increased.
  </details>
- **SP System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Stamina Points as it's known for, or even possibly Ki/Qi/Chi/Life Energy, by purchasing it you gain an extra reserve of physical stamina you can call on on top of your natural endurance, just like how HP works when paired with Gamer's Body. Using it might be required for specific skills & abilities, and used up SP will always recover given enough time.
  <br>
  - If you purchase Gamer's Body, used up SP will recover completely after six hours of sleep.
  <br>
  - If you purchase Levels, then when you level up, you'll both find that your SP is restored and that it's maximum amount is increased.
  </details>
- **Mini-Map**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - By purchasing this, you gain a 2D map which is projected on your HUD, and which is filled in through exploring the area you're in.
  <br>
  - By default, this is always in the corner of your vision, but if you wish you can have it turned off. You can also manipulate it much like the other squares in your HUD, enlarging it in order to look at a wider area, or zooming in to peer at specific ones.
  </details>
- **Mini-Map+: 3D Maps**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For an additional 5 SP, your Mini-Map gains the ability to be displayed as 3D.
  </details>
- **Mini-Map+: Map Markers**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For yet another 5 SP, you gain the ability to mark specific locations in your Mini-Map, as well as the ability to have it automatically mark areas you've explored with markers that you would find fitting. Maybe you do want to know where every restroom in a city is?
  </details>
- **Food System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Health and Stamina can be recovered by eating food, with the recovered amount increasing by how well-prepared it is.
  <br>
  - As well, you'll find that you no longer require food and water to survive, and if you don't want to have to use the restroom, you'll now find it to be optional.
  </details>
- **Levels**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the staple Gamer System sub-systems, no matter what, you always start out at level 1. By defeating things, you gain Experience/EXP/XP. Killing your opponent earns you more, and once you earn enough, you level up. When you level up, you'll find yourself completely healed and rejuvenated.
  <br>
  - You can see a person's level, a rough idea on how dangerous they are, floating above their head so long as theirs isn't 50+ above your own. There's no limit to how high a level you can attain, but the higher it is, the more XP it requires you to gather.
  <br>
  - On it's own it isn't too useful, but when combined with other systems and menus you'll find your potential growing even more.
  </details>
- **Relationship Menu**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Also known as [Contacts], or perhaps [Dramatis Personae] if you want to be pretentious, you now have a separate menu that quantifies what kind of relationships you have with specific people. It can be set up through strict categories; Friend, Friendly Acquaintance, Stranger, Enemy, etc. being examples of this. It can also be set up by a 0 to 100 percentage, with a zero signifying enemies for life and a 100 signifying a significant other with a strong connection formed with you.
  <br>
  - Relationships may become temporarily strained, but will not deteriorate with time, and you’ll have to seriously mess up to make a relationship actively decrease. This is mind reading and probability manipulation, not mind control.
  </details>
- **[Settings]+: [Toggling]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Maybe you don't want to be perfectly rational for some reason, and you want to turn Gamer's Mind off for a few moments? Or perhaps you need to convince others that you aren't some kind of superhuman videogame character and need to turn Gamer's Body off in order to prove this? With [Toggling], you'll now find that the various parts that make up your System? They can be temporarily turned off for a set time, have their settings be swapped to [High], [Medium] or [Low] functionality, or just toggled on or off until you need them back on again.
  </details>
- **Attributes**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the Gamer Staples, Attributes (also known as Stats sometimes) are a statistical measurement of your general ability, the classic examples being Strength, Dexterity, Vitality, Intelligence and Wisdom. How many attributes you have as well as what they are is up to you, but each must be reasonably powered, cover roughly the same amount of things each, and be at least possible to argue as being equal in their usefulness. You start with a reasonable number of them that represents your stats.
  <br>
  - Attributes may be improved through training them, though the higher they are, the harder they are to improve this way; there is no hard limit to how high they may rise.
  <br>
  - If you purchased Levels, then when you level up, you gain a fixed amount of Attribute Points that you can spend to improve attributes. This fixed amount is one less the number of attributes you have.
  </details>
- **Skills**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A staple of the Gamer System, by spending 10 SP on this, any ability or skill you possess becomes a Skill, with it's own skill level and increasing in power and efficiency as it levels up. This is done by gaining enough experience, which is gathered by using the skill; Level 1 is maximum inefficiency, while Level 99 is the maximum efficiency you could normally get from a master of it.
  <br>
  - While reaching 99 means you reach the normal "cap" of the skill, you can go even beyond that and enhance a skill beyond human levels, possibly increasing it's range, quality or strength. The higher a skill’s level, the more experience required to get it to the next level. Generally, the more powerful and useful a skill is, the slower it is to level up.
  <br>
  - Any powers, skills, or abilities you already possess are automatically converted into System skills. You may gain new skills by performing relevant actions; for example, throwing a knife might earn you the skill ‘Knife Throwing’. Skills will not deteriorate with time or disuse.
  </details>
- **Skills+: Prestige Skills**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For 10 SP, when you reach the max normal level of your skill (reaching level 99 in it), it may "prestige", granting you a similar but much more powerful skill at level 1 without taking away this one or, occasionally, traits, if you purchased traits. Prestige skills might themselves prestige, but in general are harder to level up.
  <br>
  - An example of a prestiged skill would be Knife Throwing prestiging into either Sword Throwing or into something like Throwing (General).
  </details>
- **Skills+: Skill Merging**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A staple boost to the Skills System, For 10 SP you gain the ability to combine certain skills into new ones, without losing the skills that are combined. They must be at least somewhat related to each other, however.
  <br>
  - An example would be Karate being combined with Taekwondo into Asian Martial Arts, or combining Pistol Shooting and Rifle Shooting into a general Shooting skill.
  </details>
- **Observe**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A unique skill that grants you basic information about what or whoever you target with it, it's one of the Staples of the original Gamer System. The more you use it, the more information you'll find yourself uncovering when you use it. You can make it's use free, but if you make it's use cost an amount of MP or SP, it's development will go by more quickly. If you encounter someone significantly more powerful than you, with Levels denoting this as 50+ your own, information gained will be sparse.
  </details>
- **Skill Books**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the Gamer Staples, this doesn't require the purchase of Skills, although they synergize.
  <br>
  - If you come across an instruction manual, book or piece of data about a topic or ability, you can absorb this knowledge and gain access to it at a basic comprehensive level. Your proficiency can be improved as you would any other skill, and gaining skills and abilities this way doesn't destroy or damage the text/housing used. Many skills will require a certain amount of a specific attribute for you to be able to learn them.
  </details>
- **Traits**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Traits, Perks, however you want to call them, are any positive, unusual qualities about yourself that wouldn’t really qualify as an ability or skill improvable through training or practice. Ex. accelerated rate of growth, 1-ups, poison immunity, etc.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Levels, then the power of traits with a quantifiable effect will increase the higher your level is. Every ten levels, you will gain a new trait relevant to how you earned those levels. These traits will never be negative.
  <br>
  - If you purchased Attributes, then you'll gain a trait when they rise at a certain level depending on how they are set up. As an example, they could do so at multiples of 50.
  </details>
- **Titles**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the Gamer Staples, through purchasing this you now have access to Titles, which are awarded to you for doing noteworthy things. Each title confers certain abilities on you while equipped; "Dragon Slayer", earned for killing one hundred dragons, might make you particularly adept at killing more of them as an example. You may only have one title equipped at a time.
  <br>
  - You may gain new, more powerful versions of titles you already possess for doing similar but more noteworthy things; killing one thousand of them might earn you "Dragon's Bane" as an upgraded title. You also gain the ability to see a person's title floating over their head.
  </details>
- **Titles+: Extra Slots**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - With a purchase of 10 SP as well as Levels, instead of only having one slot to use, you gain an additional slot for every multiple of 25 in levels you possess, starting with having 2 slots at a level of 25.
  </details>
- **[Inventory]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Another one of the Gamer Staples, you have a pocket dimension arranged like a video game inventory. You can store an unlimited amount of things in it, provided each of them is something you can physically carry. Items in your inventory are placed in a sort of stasis, so that if you put a hot beverage or wet towel in it, the beverage will not grow cool and the towel will not dry; strangely, any watches placed in your inventory will keep up with the current time. While with Levels this could change, to begin with inventorying items requires contact with you.
  <br>
  - You also gain access to an equipment screen, from which you can equip yourself with items directly from your inventory without going through the hassle of taking them out and physically putting them on.
  </details>
- **[Inventory]+: Living Storage**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For 10+ SP, your inventory is upgraded to be able to handle living, sapient beings being stored in there. People do not need to be willing in order for you to store them in your Inventory, although you will need to physically touch them.
  </details>
- **[Inventory]+: [Morrowing Placement]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - When moving objects out of your Inventory, instead of the object appearing in your hand or on the floor in front of you, you now have the ability to direct where it's placed and what kind of arrangement it has when it comes out. This also allows your ability to Inventory things to not require touch, and so long as you'd actually be able to store it into your Inventory? You now have an inventory grabbing range of 2-3 armlengths away, and easily able to be increased through leveling.
  </details>
- **Loot**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - If you kill something, you will gain money proportional to how dangerous the thing you defeated was. You may also gain items, sometimes magical, their power also proportional to how dangerous the thing you defeated was.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Skill Books, you may also gain skill books containing abilities relevant to the thing you defeated.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Inventory, you may have your loot appear in it automatically.
  </details>
- **Quests**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - One of the Gamer Staples and only for 10 SP, you may undertake quests in exchange for certain rewards upon completion, such as powerful items or notoriety. These quests can generate because of a personal goal being set, being asked to do something by another, or because something of importance is happening. Sometimes they can generate entirely randomly.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Levels , quests will always award EXP, with how much depending on the quest’s difficulty.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Traits , quests will occasionally award traits relevant to the completed quest.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Titles , quests will occasionally award titles relevant to the completed quest.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Skill Books , quests will occasionally award one relevant to the completed quest.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Classes , quests will rarely award a unique one relevant to the completed quest.
  </details>
- **Achievements**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - If you achieve certain notable milestones (ex. having 99 skills reach Level 99, killing a boss-tier opponent, or solving the "plot" of a setting you are in), then you will receive achievements along with rewards commensurate to the achievements’ difficulty. This tends to be either a suitable amount of money or an item relevant to your accomplishment (Skill-related item, the weapon said boss had, etc.)
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Levels, achievements will always award EXP.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Titles, achievements will often award relevant titles.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Traits, achievements will sometimes award relevant traits.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Classes, achievements will rarely award a relevant, unique class.
  </details>
- **[Rosetta Stone]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For 10 SP, you no longer have to worry about not understanding a foreign language. So long as it's spoken by a human/human-equivalent species, you'll now find that you can understand it. This doesn't mean you can speak it yourself, but at the very least you won't have issues figuring out what someone wants from you, or what they're getting from your attempts at translating your own language.
  </details>
- **[Rosetta Stone]+: Tongue of Babel**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Did we say understand? With an additional 10 SP you'll find that you can now speak any language known by humanity/humanity-equivalent species at least at the equivalent of someone who's spoken it for 5-10 years. We're talking sapient species, to be specific.
  </details>
- **Chatty System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Normally your System would be just that, a game system with no personality except for aiming to be slightly helpful. What flavor text is used is purely descriptive, and your system never seems to interact with you beyond that.
  <br>
  - Through purchasing Chatty System however, you'll now find that your System has a personality of it's own, designed how you'd want it to be (Besides snarky and hostile) and loyal to you and your own goals. This doesn't mean that it outright talks to you, most of the time, but the text you encounter will be less a flat description and more someone else telling you about it.
  </details>
- **Magic System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A mage’s best friend. With the MP System and Skills, you become capable of picking up any magic spells you come across, but if you want something a bit more friendly to the System or are going to a world without magic, this is the purchase for you.
  <br>
  - Built into the Gamer System is a magic system specifically designed for it. You start off with a bunch of basic spells, and as you learn more spells and grow more proficient with them, you’ll automatically become capable of more advanced ones. The kicker? There are no arbitrary limits, no ranks of magic beyond which you can never advance; you will never stop learning.
  </details>
- **Ki System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A fighter’s best friend. Where magic manipulates and relies on mana for fuel, this option does the same for ki, also called qi, chi, or life energy, here represented by SP. Basic techniques include enhancing your physical aptitude, but with enough training, you will be able to use it to enhance spells or even concepts, achieve feats of legend like parting an ocean or eluding death itself, or even manipulate the ki of others to strengthen, weaken, or control them.
  <br>
  - You start off with a bunch of basic techniques, and as you learn more techniques and grow more proficient with them, you’ll automatically become capable of more advanced ones. The kicker? There are no arbitrary limits, no ranks of ki manipulation beyond which you can never advance; you will never stop learning.
  </details>
- **Crafting System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You can sacrifice certain items to create from them a greater whole. Craft potions, forge weapons, build battlements, and more. You may also break down items into raw ‘crafting components’ of appropriate rarity to the item being deconstructed, that can then be used to craft other items of appropriate rarity.
  </details>
- **[Gatcha]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Once per day, you may make a spin of the [Gacha], winning a random amount of money, a randomly useful item, or, depending on your purchases, levels, attribute points, skill books, titles, traits, or unique classes. Also, sometimes you may win extra gacha spins.
  <br>
  - The range for how valuable the possible rewards are is immense, but the average will always be slightly useful to you, no matter how powerful you are, and no matter how worthless, will never be something negative. On some days you will win a stick, on others the Infinity+1 Sword.
  <br>
  - As this feature is entirely dependent on luck, who knows how it would be affected by something like a luck stat?
  </details>
- **[Store]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - There is a store accessible through the UI through which you can spend money to purchase useful items, as well as, depending on your purchases, levels, attribute points, skill books, titles, traits, unique classes, gacha spins, and temporary buffs/bonuses. Cost naturally scales with the value of the commodity in question. You may also sell or trade loot and items to this store.
  </details>
- **[Dungeons]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A staple of the original Gamer System, you may enter and exit ‘IDs’, or ‘Instant Dungeons’, at will. For flavor, you may have this be a creation and destruction of IDs, as in original canon, or you may have them already exist naturally, with this ability merely granting access to them. By default, IDs are barren reflections of the real world, and you will appear in it in the same location you enter it from the real world, and you will return to the real world in the same location that you exited the ID. You can bring others into the ID with you, provided they consent.
  <br>
  - With practice, though, you can cause IDs to generate non-sapient monsters to fight and train against, and the more proficient you grow, the more powerful you can make the generated monsters; once you defeat enough monsters, a boss monster may appear. With practice, you can cause the ID to take the form of new locales like forests, mountains, tundras, or even D&D-style dungeons. With practice, you can even cause time to pass faster in the ID than outside in the real world, allowing for more efficient training.
  </details>
- **[Dungeons]+: Time Dilation**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For another 20 SP, you no longer have to worry about being stuck in a dungeon for a week when it was supposed to be a couple hour thing. While inside a Dungeon, time is either paused outside of it, or slowed down. Whichever it is, it's the one that is more convenient for you at that time.
  <br>
  - Time between Worlds works similarly, if you purchased it: If you want no time to pass, then you can spend a month or year in one world and return to find not even a second has passed, and any aging you went through reversing. If time does pass while you're in a World, then you can trigger it so that you're automatically returned when a certain amount of time in the real world or game world passes.
  </details>
- **[Dungeons]+: [Worlds]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A step beyond Instant Dungeons, you now gain the ability to enter worlds that you know exist so long as you have access to it's source. Commonly this is attained through having a copy of it, ex. gaining access to the world of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker by having a copy of the PSP disc & using it as a catalyst, or entering the world of Harry Dresden by using a copy of one of the Dresden Files books.
  <br>
  - You enter the world at the start of the media's source: If you entered the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for example, then you would find yourself in the world on Harry Potter's twelfth birthday, either appearing near or at the Dursley's home.
  </details>
- **[Party] System**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - A Gamer Staple, known as [Party] under your System, you may invite others to form a ‘party’, though no more than nine people excluding yourself. Party-members may communicate to each other through text entered through the UI and will be automatically alerted when a fellow party-member is under attack. Party-members are not subject to friendly fire, and need not worry about accidentally harming one another.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased HP System, MP System, SP System, Mini-Map, Threat Cursors, Levels, Attributes, Skills, Traits, and/or Titles, then party-members will automatically gain access to those as well for as long as they’re members of the party. Any improvements to level, stats, attributes, or skills will be retained even after they’ve left the party.
  <br>
  - If you’ve purchased Levels , then you can mess around with how experience is distributed among the party. For example, you could make it divided equally, divided according to level favoring those of a higher level, divided according to level favoring those of a lower level, or divided according to who did how much damage.
  </details>
- **Classes**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For 20 SP, as well has having purchased Levels, you have access to Classes, ex. Bard, White Mage, Black Mage, Rogue, Barbarian, Knight, etc. Each class has a ‘tree’ of branching abilities that suit the class, and each time you level up, you may select one of the next available abilities on the tree to learn.
  <br>
  - You may change classes at any time, retaining any abilities you’ve gained from them, at the cost of resetting your level to 1 for the new class, with the obvious cascading effects for things that rely on your level, like HP, MP, SP, or traits; if you switch back to an old class, your level will change back to what it was when you switched out of it.
  </details>
- **Classes+: Retainment**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - By purchasing this for only 10 SP, you will retain the boosts to HP, MP, and SP even after switching classes, and traits will work based on the total levels you’ve ever had, rather than how many you currently have.
  <br>
  - Think how levels work in Dungeons and Dragons, with a character always being at level 10 even if you're multiclassed into two separate classes with 5 levels in each.
  </details>
- **Classes+: Prestige Classes**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For a purchase of 10 SP along with Classes, once you have enough levels in certain prerequisite classes, you will gain access to much more powerful ‘prestige’ classes.
  </details>
- **[Private Room]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For 20 SP, and with a purchase of Inventory, you gain the ability to make a door open up to a pocket dimension provided by your System, whether it be through a magic System-provided key or just willing it to happen while touching the door's knob. Instead of items going into your Inventory, they can be sent into here, still in stasis until you will them not be. By default it takes the appearance of an open warehouse space with concrete flooring, fluorescent lights, and an approximate area of 40,000 square feet.
  </details>
- **[Private Room]+: [Player Home]**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Private Home. Now instead of just being a warehouse, you gain the ability to make a door open up into a separate pocket dimension provided by your System. This one leads to a private home, in this case matching the size of a small apartment in a major US city. However, if you purchased Levels, then the more you use or put XP into this sub-system, the more your home will be upgraded in size and quality. With enough time and investment what started out as a cramped 1-2 room apartment can become a mansion of grand size and furniture.
  </details>
- **Save Slot**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You can ‘save’ a point in time, to which you can return at will, and may do so automatically upon death. When you use a save, it is only your own mind that is ‘sent back in time’; you do not retain any physical improvements you’ve made, and any allies you may have do not travel back with you, although mental improvements do stick around.
  <br>
  - You may save new points in time at the cost of replacing the old one, and you can only have a single one saved. Once a save is used, it is deleted.
  <br>
  - A save slot has a title, along with the date, time, & your stats at the time of saving. It also includes an image of what you were looking at during that time.
  </details>
- **x2 Extra Save Slot**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You can spend 5 extra SP along with Save Slot in order to gain additional save slots to use. You can choose while 'saving' which slot is taken over, and at a point of death you can choose between any of the Save Slots to 'reload'.
  <br>
  - If you wish you can also designate a save slot as one that cannot be deleted, which saves immediately upon you gaining the Gamer System. Perfect if you want to have a pseudo New Game+ to muck around with.

## System Flaws
- **Limited Quests**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - You may not have more than 10 quests active at a time.
  </details>
- **Book Burning**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Requiring Skill Books, the process of gaining access to the skill contained within a skill book damages or destroys it. It can do anything from simply pop out of existence with nary a sound, stick around with the text or data inside now illegible, or even fall apart into dust or outright combust away with a flash.
  </details>
- **Plugged Leak**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Requiring [Party] System and Levels, if there’s more than a difference of ten levels between the highest-level party-member and the lowest-level party member, then experience is automatically distributed according to who did how much damage.
  </details>
- **Inescapable**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Requiring [Dungeons], there will often be certain conditions preventing you from leaving Dungeons until those conditions are met, ex. you can’t leave until you’ve killed a certain number of monsters, or until you've obtained a heavily defended item.
  </details>
- **Inescapable+: Worlds**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - For double the SP that Inescapable gives you, the effect is now applied to entered Worlds as well. Until you fulfill some specific conditions, you will not be able to leave the World.
  <br>
  - This can involve solving the "plot" of said world, whether it be the standalone World's or that of the entire franchise said World is a part of. Ex. Stopping Solidus' plan in Metal Gear Solid 2, or taking out The Patriots themselves somehow, and thus ending the threat Solidus is plotting against.
  </details>
- **Profanity Filter**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Unfortunately, it seems like your Game was changed to be a bit more fitting for a young Player. Now you no longer can curse, the word coming out as something else (Fuck into duck, hell into heck, etc.) If you're using the word correctly (Saying hell to talk about Hell, calling a female dog a bitch, etc.) then the censorship isn't applied. This doesn't affect hearing other people curse.
  </details>
- **Profanity Filter~: Toggle**
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - If you want this to change when you're finally of age however, this profanity filter can be toggled once you reach at least 16 years of age, or whatever is considered a legal adult for your case, whichever is shorter. However, this filter now affects your hearing of curses while on as well. If you entered the world of Worm with it on, prepare to laugh when most of Skidmark's sentences come out as bleeps or changed cusses.
  </details>
- **Mark of The Gamer**
  - An infinity symbol on the left hand
  - A star symbol on the right hand
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Pick a spot on your body and a symbol of any kind, whether it be a game controller, circle with flame, sideways Omega, or a rune drawn on your left hand. Whenever you use your System in a meaningful way, not including your HUD but whenever you interact with your windows/squares/Systems, you'll find that your symbol glows in some fashion. Whether it glows blue with a pale mist like The Outsider's Mark, burns like hellfire or ash, or even just turns completely black, it looks unnatural and obviously unusual. Easily hidden, although the glow will slightly show through clothing.
  </details>
- **Mark of The Gamer-: Altered Body of The Gamer**
  - Your eyes change to look like the starry sky and your pupils became slit
  - Your hands gain retractable claws
  - Your hair color becomes blood red
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
  - Instead of just having a symbol that glows or becomes noticable, parts of your body start changing to reflect your System's activation. Maybe your hands and feet turn into a lightly green glowing metal, your eyes glow blue while your floating hair gains dark and light blue highlights? It has to be pretty dang obvious that you've got some kind of power active.
